# VirtualCar



# This project is a direct implementation of Artificial Intelligence(AI)@TM : Learn how to build an AI.
# About 21 lectures on Theoritical analysis and introduction to AI specific the building a Artificial Neural Network(ANN).
# Average lecture time is about 11 minutes.

# **PyTroch libraries are used on actual code implementation.
#refer: http://pytorch.org/docs/master/ for documentation on pytorch
# **Spyder: an open-source cross-platform IDE was used for going about implementation.
#refer https://pythonhosted.org/spyder/ for documentation on spyder and it's installation

#resource materials for theory and introduction on: https://www.superdatascience.com/artificial-intelligence/

#Installation and integration of pytorch and Spyder is done by a anaconda: a open source distribution software for package management.
# follow : installation of pytorch on windows: https://www.superdatascience.com/pytorch/


#additional 16 lectures on line by line walkthrough of ai.py code implementation os done over 16 lectures; average lecture time about 13 mins.
